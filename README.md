# CodeWarsChallenges
Here are some CodeWars challenges solutions I wrote.

-The challenges are ordered into the specific package, which are named with the difficulty of the challenge.

-Each class/exercise contains the challenge discription and and examples aswell. 

-Each class/exercise contains 2 methods. The solution method and the Main method which runs the solution method with an example.
